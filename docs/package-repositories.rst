.. _sysadmin_package_repositories:

Debian Package Repositories
---------------------------

All Debian based systems use APT_ as a package management tool. The lists of
repositories are defined in ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` and the ``.list`` or
``.sources`` files found in the ``/etc/apt/sources.d/`` directory. Updates can
be installed directly with the ``apt`` command-line tool, or via the GUI.

.. _package_repos_repository_formats:

Repository Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

APT_ repositories can be configured in two distinct formats, the old single
line format and the newer deb822 format. No matter what format you choose,
``apt update`` will fetch the information from all configured sources.

Single Line
^^^^^^^^^^^

Single line repositories are defined in ``.list`` files list one package
repository per line, with the most preferred source listed first. Empty lines
are ignored and a ``#`` character anywhere on a line marks the remainder of
that line as a comment.

deb822 Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The newer deb822 multiline format is used in ``.sources`` files. Each
repository consists of a stanza with multiple key value pairs. A stanza is
simply a group of lines. One file can contain multiple stanzas by separating
them with a blank line. You can still use ``#`` to comment out lines.

.. note:: Modernizing your repositories is recommended under Debian Trixie, as
   ``apt`` will complain about older repository definitions otherwise. You can
   run the command ``apt modernize-sources`` to modernize your existing
   repositories automatically.

.. _package_repos_debian_base_repositories:

Debian Base Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need a Debian base repository as a minimum to get updates for all
packages provided by Debian itself:

.. code-block:: debian.sources
  :caption: File: ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources``

  Types: deb
  URIs: http://deb.debian.org/debian/
  Suites: trixie trixie-updates
  Components: main contrib non-free-firmware
  Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg

  Types: deb
  URIs: http://security.debian.org/debian-security/
  Suites: trixie-security
  Components: main contrib non-free-firmware
  Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg

In addition, you need a package repository from Proxmox to get Proxmox Backup
updates.

.. _sysadmin_package_repos_enterprise:

`Proxmox Backup`_ Enterprise Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the stable, recommended repository. It is available for
all Proxmox Backup subscription users. It contains the most stable packages,
and is suitable for production use. The ``pbs-enterprise`` repository is
enabled by default:

.. code-block:: debian.sources
  :caption: File: ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pbs-enterprise.sources``

  Types: deb
  URIs: https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pbs
  Suites: trixie
  Components: pbs-enterprise
  Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg

To never miss important security fixes, the superuser (``root@pam`` user) is
notified via email about new packages as soon as they are available. The
change-log and details of each package can be viewed in the GUI (if available).

Please note that you need a valid subscription key to access this
repository. More information regarding subscription levels and pricing can be
found at https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-backup-server/pricing

.. note:: You can disable this repository by adding the line ``Enabled: false``
   to the stanza.

`Proxmox Backup`_ No-Subscription Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the name suggests, you do not need a subscription key to access
this repository. It can be used for testing and non-production
use. It is not recommended to use it on production servers, because these
packages are not always heavily tested and validated.

We recommend to configure this repository in
``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/proxmox.sources``.

.. code-block:: debian.sources
  :caption: File: ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/proxmox.sources``

  Types: deb
  URIs: http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pbs
  Suites: trixie
  Components: pbs-no-subscription
  Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg

`Proxmox Backup`_ Test Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository contains the latest packages and is heavily used by developers
to test new features.

.. .. warning:: the ``pbstest`` repository should (as the name implies)
  only be used to test new features or bug fixes.

You can access this repository by adding the following stanza to
``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/proxmox.sources``:

.. code-block:: debian.sources
  :caption: sources.list entry for ``pbstest``

  Types: deb
  URIs: http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pbs
  Suites: trixie
  Components: pbs-test
  Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg

.. _package_repositories_client_only:

Proxmox Backup Client-only Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to :ref:`use the Proxmox Backup Client <client_creating_backups>`
on systems using a Linux distribution not based on Proxmox projects, you can
use the client-only repository.

Currently there's only a client-repository for APT based systems.

.. _package_repositories_client_only_apt:

APT-based Proxmox Backup Client Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For modern Linux distributions using `apt` as package manager, like all Debian
and Ubuntu Derivative do, you may be able to use the APT-based repository.

In order to configure this repository you need to first :ref:`setup the Proxmox
release key <package_repos_secure_apt>`. After that, add the repository URL to
the APT sources lists.

snippet

.. code-block:: sources.list
  :caption: File: ``/etc/apt/sources.list``

  deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pbs-client buster main

.. _package_repos_secure_apt:

SecureApt
~~~~~~~~~

The `Release` files in the repositories are signed with GnuPG. APT is using
these signatures to verify that all packages are from a trusted source.

If you install Proxmox Backup Server from an official ISO image, the
verification key is already installed.

If you install Proxmox Backup Server on top of Debian, download and install the
key with the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

 # wget https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/proxmox-archive-keyring-trixie.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg

.. note:: The `wget` command above adds the keyring for Proxmox releases based
   on Debian Trixie. Once the `proxmox-archive-keyring` package is installed,
   it will manage this file. At that point, the hashes below may no longer
   match the hashes of this file, as keys for new Proxmox releases get added or
   removed. This is intended, `apt` will ensure that only trusted keys are
   being used. **Modifying this file is discouraged once
   `proxmox-archive-keyring` is installed.**

Verify the SHA256 checksum afterwards with the expected output below:

.. code-block:: console

 # sha256sum /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
 136673be77aba35dcce385b28737689ad64fd785a797e57897589aed08db6e45 /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg

and the md5sum, with the expected output below:

.. code-block:: console

 # md5sum /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg
 77c8b1166d15ce8350102ab1bca2fcbf /usr/share/keyrings/proxmox-archive-keyring.gpg

.. note:: Make sure that the path that you download the key to, matches the
   path specified in the ``Signed-By:`` lines in your repository stanzas from
   above.

.. _node_options_http_proxy:

Repository Access Behind HTTP Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some setups have restricted access to the internet, sometimes only through a
central proxy. You can setup a HTTP proxy through the Proxmox Backup Server's
web-interface in the `Configuration -> Authentication` tab.

Once configured this proxy will be used for apt network requests and for
checking a Proxmox Backup Server support subscription.

Standard HTTP proxy configurations are accepted, `[http://]<host>[:port]` where
the `<host>` part may include an authorization, for example:
`http://user:pass@proxy.example.org:12345`
